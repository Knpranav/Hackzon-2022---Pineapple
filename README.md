IDEA UNIQUENESS : Its a solution we're providing to an actual problem faced by mobile librarians who have to travel Door - Door to provide books.

CODE QUALITY  : The code is written purely in Java.
                REFACTORED - Our code is refactored, follows most guidelines of refactoring. We did not compromise on having clean code.
                DESIGN PATTERN - The code also has a hybrid design pattern with a mix of Builder pattern and Prototype Pattern.
                REUSABILITY - The Code can be used as a of the shelf code in other book recommender systems.
                MAINTAINABILITY - Becasue of its refactored form, written using XP SDLC Model,it becomes very simple to maintain
                                  and understand what's happening in the code.




                                PROBLEM 1 : 
There lies today a real world problem faced by a librarian we know.
He issues books to customers by a van carrying anywhere upto 120 books and spending about 15-20 mins at a stop.

He predicts the customer's choice on what they would read, manually.
He has no choice but to carry many books incase he can't convinve the right recommendation.
To solve this our Library book recommender goes through multiple rules

                                SOLUTION 1 :

  Such As - -
    *  Age Rule - Checks the category of age for recommending boojs
       
    *  Genre Category - Checks for the Predominant genres in previously read books and suggests from the same genre.
       
    *  Previously Read Books  - Checks for what's read previously, and suggests from similar kinds of books.
     
    *  Availability  - Checks if the book recommended is available to hand it out.
       
    *  Prequel / Sequal  - Recommends the Seques of a book or Prequel from history of read books.
       
       
     This significantly reduces the amount of books he has to carry, because the recommender does the job of 
     exactly pinpointing what kind of the customer would be interested in reading.
     He spends significantly less time to interact in exchanging books and offering new ones.
     
    
   PROBLEM 2 :
                          
      To provide books to people on a given day, he has to navigate himself in an order to cater customers.
      Even though he has the recommended books to provide, the order in which he goes to people could be faulty.
      It may not be the most optimal route.

      Thus we present our 2nd solution to this problem
    
    
   SOLUTION 2 :


      Considering him as a Travelling Salseman, we re-arrange the order in which he has to meet people by finding the most optimal route
      from his location. It provides the shortest route possible in the given coordinates of customers.
      He thus travels in the most efficient way possible spending less time travelling without re-counting distance.
